    "text": "Tabular method\nAn easier (faster) way to do integration by parts is known as the Tabular method. The tabular method can quickly calculate repeated integration by parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample (Stop 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following example will show the first ‘stop’ used in tabular integration.\nFind the solution to the following integral\n\n\\int x^2 \\sin(3x) \\, dx\n\nThis could be solved using our formula for integration by parts, but this results in a messy calculation using repeated integration by parts. In order to solve these problems faster, we will use the Tabular method.\nFirst, choose two terms to work with in the integral. We will choose x^2 and \\sin(3x). We want to choose a term that will eventually default to 0 after repeated differention. Place this term under the D in your table, and the other term under the I. Draw a plus to the left of your terms.\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n& \\hspace{0.25in} D \\hspace{0.25in} & I\\\\\n+ & \\hspace{0.25in} x^2 \\hspace{0.25in} & \\sin(3x)\n\\end{array}\nTo begin, we will differentiate the term under our D, and integrate the term under our I, then flip the sign.\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n& \\hspace{0.25in} D \\hspace{0.25in} & I\\\\\n+ & \\hspace{0.25in} x^2 \\hspace{0.25in} & \\sin(3x)\\\\\n- & \\hspace{0.25in} 2x \\hspace{0.25in} & \\frac{1}{3}\\cos(3x)\n\\end{array}\nRepeating this process eventually gives us a 0 in our D column. This is our first stop, meaning we don’t need any more steps.\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n& \\hspace{0.25in} D \\hspace{0.25in} & I\\\\\n+ & \\hspace{0.25in} x^2 \\hspace{0.25in} & \\sin(3x)\\\\\n- & \\hspace{0.25in} 2x \\hspace{0.25in} & -(1/3)\\cos(3x)\\\\\n+ & \\hspace{0.25in} 2 \\hspace{0.25in} & -(1/9)\\sin(3x)\\\\\n- & \\hspace{0.25in} 0 \\hspace{0.25in} & (1/27)\\cos(3x)\\\\\n\\end{array}\nMultiply the n^{th} under the D by the (n+1)^{th} term under the I. Then add or subtract the product by the sign the the left of the D column. This is the answer to our integral.\n\n\\int x^2 \\sin (3x) \\,dx = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2\\cos(3x) + \\frac{2}{9}x\\sin(3x) - \\frac{2}{27}\\cos(3x) + C\n\nAnd we’re done!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample (Stop 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following example will show the second ‘stop’ used in tabular integration.\n\n\\int x^4 \\ln x \\,dx\n\nAlthough it seems obvious we should put x^4 under the D column, we quickly realize that we cannot integrate \\ln x without integration by parts. Because of this, we have no choice but to but \\ln x under the D column. Carrying on with our calculations\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n& \\hspace{0.25in} D \\hspace{0.25in} & I\\\\\n+ & \\hspace{0.25in} \\ln x \\hspace{0.25in} & x^4\\\\\n- & \\hspace{0.25in} x^{-1} \\hspace{0.25in} & (1/5)x^5\n\\end{array}\nWe can quickly notice that 0 will never appear under the D column. This is where our second stop comes in. If we can easily calculate the integral of a rows product (That is, the product of terms under the D and I columns for a singular row) than we stop, and add the integral of that row to our diagonal solution.\n\n\\int x^4 \\ln x \\,dx = \\frac{1}{5}x^5\\ln x  - \\frac{1}{5} \\int x^{-1}x^5\n\nThis is formula for regular integration by parts, so unfortunately this didn’t save us any time, but we still got the right answer!\n\n\\int x^4 \\ln x \\,dx = \\frac{1}{5}x^5\\ln x  - \\frac{1}{25} x^5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample (Stop 3)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following example will show the third ‘stop’ used in tabular integration.\n\n\\int e^x \\sin x \\,dx\n\nIntegrating e^x and \\sin x are both easy. I’ll choose to integrate e^x for simplicity sake.\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n& \\hspace{0.25in} D \\hspace{0.25in} & I\\\\\n+ & \\hspace{0.25in} \\sin x \\hspace{0.25in} & e^x\\\\\n- & \\hspace{0.25in} \\cos x \\hspace{0.25in} & e^x\\\\\n+ & \\hspace{0.25in} -\\sin x \\hspace{0.25in} & e^x\\\\\n- & \\hspace{0.25in} -\\cos x \\hspace{0.25in} & e^x\n\\end{array}\nClearly this will go on forever without a 0 under our D column, or an easily integrable row. This introduces our third stop. Notice that our first and third rows only differ by a constant coefficient. When this happens, we write our diagonalization and our integral, stopping at the repeated row.\n\n\\int e^x \\sin x \\,dx = e^x \\sin x - e^x \\cos(x) - \\int e^x \\sin x \\, dx\n\nNotice how this is the same integral on the left and right hand of the equation. Moving the integral over gives us\n\n2\\int e^x \\sin x \\,dx = e^x \\sin x - e^x \\cos(x)\n\nDiving by 2\n\n\\int e^x \\sin x \\,dx = \\frac{e^x \\sin x - e^x \\cos(x)}{2}\n\nAnd we have our answer.\n\n\n\nClearly the tabular method is a huge time saver for repeated integration by parts."

    "text": "Method\nWhen given an integral in the form\n\n\\int \\frac{P(X)}{Q(X)} \\, dx\n\nWhere P(x) and Q(x) are polynomials such that the degree of Q(x) is higher than the degree of P(x). We can decompose the fraction based on the factors of Q(x). There are four cases for the factors of Q(x).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecomposition cases\n\n\n\n\n\nCase I: Distinct linear factors\nWhen Q(x) has distinct linear factors, i.e.\n\nQ(x) = (a_1 x + b_1)(a_2 x + b_2)\n\nWe decompose into the following terms\n\n\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \\frac{A}{a_1x + b_1} + \\frac{B}{a_2x + b_2}\n\nCase 2: Repeated linear factors\nWhen Q(x) has repeated linear factors, i.e.\n\nQ(x) = (a x + b)^k\n\nWe decompose into the following terms\n\n\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \\frac{A_1}{ax + b} + \\frac{A_2}{(ax + b)^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{A_k}{(a x + b)^k}\n\nCase 3: Distinct quadratic factors\nWhen Q(x) has distinct quadratic factors, i.e.\n\nQ(x) = (a_1 x^2 + b_1x + c_1)(a_2 x^2 + b_2x + c_2)\n\nWe decompose into the following terms\n\n\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \\frac{A}{a_1 x^2 + b_1x + c_1} + \\frac{B}{a_2 x^2 + b_2x + c_2}\n\nCase 4: Repeated quadratic factors\nWhen Q(x) has repeated quadratic factors, i.e.\n\nQ(x) = (a x^2 + bx + c)^k\n\nWe decompose into the following terms\n\n\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \\frac{A_1}{a x^2 + bx + c} + \\cdots + \\frac{A_k}{(a x^2 + bx + c)^k}\n\n\n\n\nNote that Q(x) does not have one case of factors exculsivly. For example\n\nQ(x) = (a_1x+b_1)(a_2x^2 + b_2x + c_2)^2\n\nWill decompose into\n\n\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \\frac{A}{a_1x + b_1} + \\frac{B}{a_2 x^2 + b_2x + c_2} + \\frac{C}{(a_2 x^2 + b_2x + c_2)^2}\n\nNext we need a method for finding the value of the constants in the numerator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating constants\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the integral from the beginning\n\n\\int \\frac{3x + 11}{x^2 - x - 6} \\,dx\n\nWe can now decompose the integrand to obtain\n\n\\frac{3x + 11}{x^2 - x - 6} = \\frac{A}{x - 3} + \\frac{B}{x + 2}\n\nThe problem is now finding values for the constants A,B which make the relation true. By cross multiplying the right side of the equation we get\n\n\\frac{3x + 11}{x^2 - x - 6} = \\frac{A(x + 2) + B(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 2)}\n\nWhich simplifies to\n\n3x + 11 = A(x + 2) + B(x - 3).\n\nWe can then create a system of equations such that the above expression is always true. This method is long but will always work. The faster method (that isn’t always possible) is to find values of x such that the equation reduces. Using the faster method, we obtain\n\nx = 3 \\: : \\: 3(3) + 11 = A(3 + 2) + B(3 - 3) \\implies A = 4\\\\\nx = -2 \\: : \\: 3(-2) + 11 = A(-2 + 2) + B(-2 - 3) \\implies B = -1\n\nWhich gives us our final expression\n\n\\frac{3x + 11}{x^2 - x - 6} = \\frac{4}{x - 3} - \\frac{1}{x + 2}\n\nWhich as shown above, makes the integral trivial to solve.\n\n\\int{{\\frac{{3x + 11}}{{{x^2} - x - 6}}\\,dx}} = 4\\ln |x - 3| - \\ln |x + 2| + C."

## Definition

A [**binary operation**]{.definition} $\star$ on a set $A$ is a function $\star \colon A \times A \to A$.
:::

We commonly denote $\star(a,b)$ as $a \star b$ using _infix_ notation. Binary operations may have the following properties

## Definition

Let $\star$ be a binary relation $A$,

-   We call $\star$ [**associative**]{.definition} on $A$ if for all $a,b,c \in A$

$$
(a \star b) \star c = a \star (b \star c)
$$

-   We call $\star$ [**commutative**]{.definition} on $A$ if for all $a,b \in A$

$$
a \star b = b \star a
$$

Addition is an example of an associative and commutative binary operation on $\mathbb{Z}$. Multiplication is also an associative and commutative binary operation, whereas something like subtraction is neither associative nor commutative.

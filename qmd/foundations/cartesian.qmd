We have a definition for the cartesian product of two sets, but we can extend this definition.

## Definition

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a nonempty collection of sets.

An [indexing function]{.definition} on $\mathcal{A}$ is a surjective function $f$ from some set $J$, called the [index set]{.definition}, to $\mathcal{A}$.

The collection $\mathcal{A}$ with the indexing function $f$ is called an [indexed family of sets]

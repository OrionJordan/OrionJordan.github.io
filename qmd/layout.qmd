## TODO

-   Add home page, intro to self, contact
-   Custom ink-scape svg
-   Add images, dark mode priority, light mode later
-   Content

## Colors

Dark Mode: `BG: #222222`

## Callouts

Callouts are used to section parts of the content together.  

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

Definitions use ``.callout-note`` and explain a mathematical concept or term to be referenced. The definition callout should not be used for notation, but may include notation of the concept. The key term being discussed will be [highlighted]{.definition} by applying `{.definition}` to the key term. 

The key term will appear bold, and be colored `blue` in light mode, and `cyan` in dark mode.
:::

## Tikz

I use 'knitr', the engine for 'R' in order to render tikz images. Use `fig-ext: svg` for transparent backgrounds and svg outputs.

TO-DO: Add light mode support (Wait for 1.5-1.6?)

Real analysis exam 2

If $f^\prime$ is bounded on $(a,b)$, prove $f$ is uniformly continuous on $(a,b)$.

Show that any function with finite disconiutities is integerable.

Show that if $f$ is integerable $1/f$ is integerable

Taylor series nonsense

Most of the previous methods for proving the limit of a sequence require us to have some idea of the limit before we proceed. This section will cover techniques to prove that a limit exists, even if we don't know the precise value the sequence converges to. 

## Monotone Sequences

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

A sequence $(s_n)$ of real numbers is [**increasing**]{.definition} if $s_n \leq s_{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and is [**decreasing**]{.definition} if $s_n \geq s_{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A sequence is monotone if it is increasing or decreasing.

## Theorem 1.3.1 (Monotone Convergence Theorem)

A monotone sequence is convergent if and only if it is bounded.

## Proof

Suppose $(s_n)$ is a bounded increasing sequence. Let $S$ denote the nonempty bounded set $\{s_n \colon n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. By the completness axiom, $S$ has a least upper bound, and we let $s = \sup S$. We claim that $\lim s_n = s$. Given any $\varepsilon > 0$, $s - \varepsilon$ is not an upper bound for $S$. Thus there exists a natural number $N$ such that $s_N > s - \varepsilon$. Since $(s_n)$ is increasing and $s$ is an upper bound for $S$, we have 

$$
s - \varepsilon < s_N \leq s_n \leq s
$$

for all $n \geq N$. Hence $(s_n)$ converges to $s$. When the sequence is decreasing, we let $s = \inf S$ and the proof is nearly identical. For completness sake

We claim that $\lim s_n = s$. Given any $\varepsilon > 0$, $s + \varepsilon$ is not a lower bound for $S$. Thus there exists some natural number $N$ such that $s_N < s + \varepsilon$. Since $(s_n)$ is decreasing and $s$ is a lower bound for $S$, we have

$$
s + \varepsilon > s_N \geq s_n \geq s
$$

for all $n \geq N$. Thus $(s_n)$ converges to $s$.

The converse, that a convergent sequence is bounded, was proved in Theorem $1.1.3$.

## Definition

A [**sequence**]{.definition} is a, possibly infinite, collection of numbers such that each number is indexed by a natural number.
:::

For example, the following is a sequence

$$
(F_n) = \left(1,1,2,3,5,8,13,\dots\right)
$$

known as a the *Fibbonachi* sequence. We can denote each term by its placement, such that $F_3 = 2$, and $F_7 = 13$. 

For the purposes of real analysis, we will formalize sequences as functions from subsets of the natural numbers to the reals.

## Notation

Let $f \colon A \to S$ be a function such that $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. We call this function a sequence. We choose some symbol, for example $a$, to represent the elements of the sequence. 

For each $n \in A$, let $a_n$ denote $f(n)$, and $(a_n)$ denote $f$ We may also denote a sequence $(a_n)$ by listing all of its terms,

$$
(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n).

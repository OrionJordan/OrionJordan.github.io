## Definition

A [**sequence**]{.definition} is a collection of terms such that each term is indexed by a natural number.
:::

Sequences may be finite or infinite, and their terms may be numbers or functions. For example, the following is a sequence of Fibbonachi numbers,

$$
\left(1,1,2,3,5,8,13,\dots\right).
$$

We can denote each term by its placement, for example $F_3 = 2$, and $F_7 = 13$.

## Notation
We use $(a_n)$ to denote a sequence, and $a_n$ without parenthesis to denote the $n^{th}$-term of the sequence.

We also use the notation $(a_1,a_2,a_3,\dots)$ to denote a sequence. All terms are sequential and commas are used to seperate terms.
:::

It is common to formalize sequences through functions, though our intuitive understanding will work just fine for the purposes of analysis.

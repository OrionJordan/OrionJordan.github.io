## Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and $S$ be a set.

If $f \colon A \to S$ is a function, then $f$ is a [sequence]{.definition}.
:::

Sequences may be finite or infinite, and their terms may be numbers or functions.

## Notation

Let $f \colon A \to S$ be a sequence.

It is common to choose some letter, usually $s$, to represent the elements of this sequence.

For each $k \in A$, $f(k)$ is denoted $s_k$, and $f$ is denoted $(s_k)_{k\in A}$.
:::

For example, the following is a sequence of Fibbonachi numbers,

$$
\left(1,1,2,3,5,8,13,\dots\right).
$$

We would denote the sequence $(F_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$, where $F_1 = 1$, $F_2 = 1$, $F_3 = 2$, ect.

## Theorem

Let $f \colon D \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in D$. Then the following three conditions are equivalent

$(a)\;$ $f$ is continuous at $c$.

$(b)\;$ If $(x_n)$ is any sequence in $D$ such that $(x_n)$ converges to $c$.

$(c)\;$ For every neighborhood $V$ of $f(c)$ there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $c$ such that $f(U \cap D) \subseteq V$.

Futhermore if $c$ is an accumulation point of $D$, then the above are all equivalent to 

$(d)\;$ $f$ has a limit at $c$ and $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$.

## Theorem

Let $f \colon D \to \mathbb{R}$ and $c \in D$. Then $f$ is discontinous at $c$ if and only if there exists a sequence $(x_n)$ in $D$ such that $(x_n)$ converges to $c$ but the sequence $(f(x_n))$ does not converge to $f(c)$.

## Example

Take the function $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ where

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
1 \text{ if $x$ is rational}\\
0 \text{ if $x$ is irrational}
\end{cases}
$$

## Theorem (Algebraic Relations of continuouity)

Let $f,g \colon D \to \mathbb{R}$ and $c \in D$. If $f,g$ are both continous at the point $c,$ then 

$(a)\;$ $f + g$ and $fg$ are continous at $c$, and

$(b)\;$ $f/g$ is continous at $c$ if $g(c) \not = 0$.

## Theorem (Algebraic Relations of continuouity)

Let $f \colon D \to \mathbb{R}$ and $g \colon E \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(D) \subseteq E$.

If $f$ is continuous at $c \in D$ and $g$ is continous at $f(c)$, then $g \circ f \colon D \to \mathbb{R}$ is continous at $c$.

:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Proof

We want to show that given any neighborhood $V$ of $g(f(c))$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $c$ such that $f(U \cap D) \subseteq V$.

Since $g$ is continous at $f(c)$, we know that there exists a neighborhood $W$ of $f(c)$ such that $g(W \cap E) \subseteq V$. Similarly since $f$ is continous at $c$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $c$ such that $f(U \cap D) \subseteq W$.

## Theorem 

A function $f$ is continous on its domain $D$ if and only if for every open set $U$ of $\mathbb{R}$, there exists an open subset $V$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $V \cap D = f^{-1}(u)$.

:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Proof 


**WTS:** $f$ being continous on $D$ implies $V \cap D = f^{-1}(u)$ .

Assume $f$ is continous on $D$. Let $U$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$. If $c \in f^{-1}(U)$, then $f(c) \in U$. Since $U$ is open, there exists a neighborhood $U^\prime \subseteq U$ containing $f(c)$. Since $f$ is continous, there exists a neighborhood $V(c)$ of $c$ such that $f(V(c) \cap D) \subseteq U^\prime$.

Let $V = \bigcup_{c \in f^{-1}(u)}V(c)$. Now since $V(c)$ is open, we know $V$ is open and $V \cap D = f^{-1}(U)$. $\square$

**WTS:** $V \cap D = f^{-1}(u)$ implies that $f$ is continous on $D$.

## Definition

A function $f \colon D \to \mathbb{R}$ is called bounded if $f(D)$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ where there exists some $M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $|f(x)| \leq M$ for all $x \in D$.

:::

One may question if every continous function is bounded. They are not.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Theorem

If $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a compact subset and $f \colon D \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then $f(D)$ is compact.

:::

Slogan, a continous image of compact is again compact. Compact meaing closed and bounded. 

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Proof

Let $U = \{U_i\}$ be an open cover of $f(D)$. Since $f$ is continuous on $D$, we have that for each $U_i$, there exists an open set $V_i$ such that $V_i \cap D = f^{-1}(U_i)$. Since $f(D) \subseteq \bigcup U_i$, we have $D \subseteq \bigcup f^{-1}(u_i) \subseteq \bigcup V_i$ so $\{V_i\}$ is an open cover of $D$.

Since $D$ is compact, there exists finetly many $$V_1,\dots,V_n$ such that $D \subseteq V_1 \cup \cdots \cup V_N$ hence $D \subseteq (V_1 \cap D) \cup \cdots \cup (V_N \cap D)$ which implies $f(D) \subseteq U_1 \cup \cdots \cup U_N$, thus $\{U_1,\ldots,U_n\}$ is a finite subcover of $U$. Hence $f(D)$ is compact. \square

## Corollary

Let $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $f \colon D \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $D$. Then, $f$ attains a minimum and maximum on $D$.

:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Theorem

We know from our last proof that $f(D)$ is compact. And from the Heine theorem, must be closed and bounded, and therefore has a minimum and maximum.

:::

It is neccessary for $D$ to be compact, closed and bounded.

## Theorem (Intermediate Value Theorem)

Let $f \colon [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous. For any value $k$ between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, there exists $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f(c) = k$.

:::

We first prove this by proving a related Lemma.

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Lemma

Let $f \colon [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous, and suppose $f(a) < 0 < f(b)$. Then there exists $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f(c) = 0$.

:::


::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Proof

Let $S = \{x \in [a,b] \colon f(x) \leq 0\}$. Notice $S$ is bounded, and by our assumuption $a \in S$. Since $S$ is not empty, and $S$ is bounded, we have that $c = \sup S$ exists in $[a,b]$. We want to show $f(c) = 0$.

**Case 1:** Suppose $f(c) < 0$. 

 **WTS:** This assumption contradicts $c$ being a supremum of $S$, because $c$ is not an upper bound of $S$. 
 
 There exists a neighborhood $U$ of $c$ such that $f(x) < 0$ for all $x \in U \cap [a,b]$. Since we're  assumming $f(c) < 0 < f(b)$, we have that $c \not = b$, and thus there exists some $p \in U$ such that $c<p<b$. But $p \in U$ hence $f(p) < 0$. This contradicts our assumption that $c$ is an upper bound for $S$, so $f(c)$ must be $< 0$.

**Case 2:** Suppose $f(c) > 0$. 

**WTS:** This assumption contradicts $c$ being a supremum of $S$, because $c$ is not a least upper bound of $S$.

If $f(c) > 0$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $c$ such that $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \cup [a,b]$, since $f(a) < 0 < f(c)$. We have $c \not = a$ and thus $U$ contains some point, $p$. We have $0 < p < c$. Since $f(x) > 0$ for $x \in U$

:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Proof

Let $k$ be any real number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. If $f(a)$ is less than $f(b)$, we apply the previous lemma to a new function given by $g(x) = f(x) - k$. 

Then $g(a) = f(a) - k < 0$. Then $g(b) = f(b) - k > 0$. We can then apply the lemma from before to guarentee the existence of $c \in (a,b)$ such that $g(c) = 0$. This is equivalent to saying that $f(c) = k$.

In the reverse case, the same argument works where $g(x) = k - f(x)$. \square

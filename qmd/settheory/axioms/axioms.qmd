Below list the axioms of ZFC assuming FOL.

We start with two primitive notions, which cannot be defined. These being an object called a "set" $\{\}$, and a relation called "contains" $\in$.

## Axiom of Extensionality.

If two sets have the same members, they are equal:

$$
\forall y \forall z \left[\forall x (x \in y \iff x \in z) \implies y = z\right]
$$
:::

In english, this means for all sets $A,B$, if for all elements $x$ in $A$ if and only if $x$ in $B$, then $A = B$.

We have the following definitions for additional symbols

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

We denote the following

- $x \not \in y$ if $\lnot(x \in y)$

- $x \subseteq y$ if $\forall z \in x(z \in y)$

- $x \subset y$ if $(x \subseteq y) \land \lnot(x = y)$

## Existence Axioms

The following axioms ensure the existence of many fundamental sets.

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Empty Set Axiom

There is a set with no members:

$$
\exists y \forall x, x \not \in y
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Pairing Axiom

For any two sets $u$ and $v$, there is a set having as members just $u$ and $v$:

$$
\forall u \forall v \exists B \forall x (x \in B \iff x = u \lor x = v)
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Union Axiom (weak form)

For any two sets $a$ and $b$, there is a set having whose members are the elements of $a$ or $b$ (or both):

$$
\forall a \forall b \exists B \forall x (x \in B \iff x \in a \lor x \in b)
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Power Set Axiom

For any set $a$, there is a set whose members are exactly the subsets of $a$:

$$
\forall a \exists B \forall x (x \in B \iff x \subseteq a)
$$
:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

Let $x$ be the set with no members.

We denote $x$ as $\varnothing$, and call it the [empty set]{.definition}.
:::

## Number construction

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

Let $S$ be a function known as the [successor]{.definition} function, defined by

$$
S(a) = a \cup \{a\}.
$$

where $a$ is a set.
:::

Then we can construct our numbers by repeatedly applying the successor function to the empty set.

$$
\begin{align*}
0 &= \{\} &=& \varnothing\\
1 &= \{0\} &=& \{\varnothing\}\\
2 &= \{0,1\} &=& \{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}\\
3 &= \{0,1,2\} &=& \{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\},\{\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}\}\}
\end{align*}
$$

ZFC contains $10$ axioms for sets

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Extensionality Axiom

If two sets have the same members, they are equal:

$$
\forall A \forall B \left[\forall x (x \in A \iff x \in B) \implies A = B\right]
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Empty Set Axiom

There is a set with no members:

$$
\exists B \forall x, x \not \in B
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Pairing Axiom

For any two sets $u$ and $v$, there is a set having as members just $u$ and $v$:

$$
\forall u \forall v \exists B \forall x (x \in B \iff x = u \lor x = v)
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Union Axiom (weak form)

For any two sets $a$ and $b$, there is a set having whose members are the elements of $a$ or $b$ (or both):

$$
\forall a \forall b \exists B \forall x (x \in B \iff x \in a \lor x \in b)
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Power Set Axiom

For any set $a$, there is a set whose members are exactly the subsets of $a$:

$$
\forall a \exists B \forall x (x \in B \iff x \subseteq a)
$$

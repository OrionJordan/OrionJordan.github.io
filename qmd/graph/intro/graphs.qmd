## Definition

A [**graph**]{style="color: blue"} is a set of points called [**vertices**]{style="color: blue"} connected by [**edges**]{style="color:blue"}.

(Insert graph example)

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

A graph $G = (V,E)$ is a mathematical structure consisting of a [**vertex set**]{style="color: blue"} $V(G)$ and an [**edge set**]{style="color: blue"} $E(G)$. Each edge $e$ in the edge set connects two (not necessarily distinct) vertices known as the [**endpoints**]{style="color: blue"} of $e$.
:::

An edge is said to [**join**]{style="color: blue"} its endpoints. Say an edge $e$ connects two vertices $u$ and $v$. $u$ is said to be [**adjacent**]{style="color: blue"} and a [**neighbor**]{style="color: blue"} of $v$.

## Example

The vertex and edge sets of the graph in Figure 1.1.1 are

$$
V(G) = \{a,b,c,d\} \quad\quad\quad\quad E(G) = \{ab,ac,ad,bc,bd,cd\}
$$

Notice how we can denote an edge by concatenating its endpoints. This is only possible in cases where exclusively one edge exist between two vertices.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

An edge $e$ can be called

-   A [**proper edge**]{style="color: blue"} when the edge joins two distinct vertices

-   A [**loop**]{style="color: blue"} when $e$ joins a vertex to itself

-   A [**multi-edge**]{style="color: blue"} when two or more edges connect the same two vertices
:::

There are many instances in graph theory where our graphs are both loopless and devoid of multi-edges. In these cases we call the graph [**simple**]{style="color: blue"}. If our graph is empty, we call it a [**null graph**]{style="color: blue"}. If our graph contains one vertex and no edges, the graph is [**trivial**]{style="color: blue"}.

## Common Families of Graphs

### Complete Graphs

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

A [**complete graph**]{style="color: blue"} is a simple graph where there exist an edge between every pair of distinct vertices. A complete graph with $n$ vertices is notated $K_n$.
:::

(Insert picture of graphs K1 through K5)

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Theorem

A complete graph $K_n$ contains $\binom{n}{2}$ edges.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Proof

The graph $K_n$ has an edge between every pair of distinct vertices. Because order doesn't affect edges ($e = uv$ is equivalent to $e = vu$), the number of edges is analougous to $n$ choose $2$, $\binom{n}{2}$.
:::

### Bipartite Graphs

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

A [**bipartite graph**]{style="color: blue"} $G$ is a simple graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into two subsets $U$ and $V$, such that every edge in $G$ has one endpoint in $U$, and one edpoint in $V$.
:::

(Insert picture of a few bipartite graphs)

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Proposition

A bipartite graph cannot contain any loops.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Proof

If an edge was loop, it would connect the same vertex to both endpoints, which contradicts our definition of a bipartite graph.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

A [**complete bipartite graph**]{style="color: blue"} $G$ is a simple bipartite graph such that every vertex in one of the bipartition subsets is joined to every other vertex in the other bipartite subset. A complete bipartite graph is notated $K_{m,n}$ where $m$ is the number of vertices in one of the graphs bipartite set, and $n$ is the number of vertices in the other.

### Regular Graphs

To look at regular graphs, we first have to look at

We could also apply an operation *r*, which rotates the hexagon by $\\pi / 3$ radians. These operations swap the location of the vertices of the hexagon.\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(Insert picture of a hexagon being rotated and symetry)](symmetric-groups_files/figure-html/example-graph-1.png){fig-align='center' width=192}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nIf we represent the orignal labelling of the vertices as\n\n$$\n\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\n$$\n\nThen we can represent our operations $r$ and $s$ as the permutations\n\n$$\nr = \\{2,3,4,5,6,1\\} \\quad s = \\{1,6,5,4,3,2\\}\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Definition\n\nA [**symmetry**]{style=\"color: blue\"} is a reordering of the vertices on a geometric shape such that their structure remains. We typically denote a symmetry with $\\sigma$.\n:::\n\nFor polygons in $2$-space, we say that the 'structure' of the polygon remains if it can be transferred to $3$-space, rotated, and then placed back into $2$-space.\n\nThus our operations $r$ and $s$ are symmetries of the polygon. They can be combined to produce additional symmetries. The set of all possible symmetries on a $n$-polygon is denoted $D_{2n}$.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Definition\n\nThe set of symmetries on an $n$-polygon is denoted $D_{2n}$, and called the [**dihedral group of order**]{style=\"color: blue\"} $2n$.\n:::\n\nWe will prove that $D_{2n}$ is indeed a group later, but for now it can be taken as fact. $D_{2n}$ has $2n$ symmetries, all of which can be constructed via compositions of our symmetries $r$ and $s$.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n## Example\n\nLets examine the group $D_{12}$, the symmetries of a hexagon.\n\nFirst lets look at our possible rotations $r$. Let $e$ be the orignal labelling of the vertices, and $r$ be defined\n\n$$\nr \\colon \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\} \\to \\{2,3,4,5,6,1\\}\n$$\n\nWe can repeatedly compose $r$ to construct the following symmetries\n\n$$\ne, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5.\n$$\n\nNote that $r^6 = r^0 = e$, thus $|r| = 6$.\n\nNext we can look at our reflections. Let $s$ be defined \n\n$$\ns \\colon \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\} \\to \\{1,6,5,4,3,2\\}\n$$ \n\nNote that $s^2 = e$. Combining $s$ and $r$, we can create\n$$\ns, sr, sr^2, sr^3, sr^5, sr^6\n$$\n\nGiving us six new symmetries. This gives us a total of 12 symmmetries in $D_{12}$. \n\n:::\n\nIt should be noted that $D_{12}$ is not abelian, which can be clearly be seen with\n\n$$\nrs = \\{6,5,4,3,2,1\\} = sr^5 \\quad sr = \\{2,1,6,5,4,3\\}\n$$\n\n## Symmetric Groups\n\nWe may expand our notion of symmetry to include all permutations of the same collection of elements. This creates the more general *symmetric group* $S_\\Omega$\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Definition\n\nLet $\\Omega$ is a non-empty set. $S_\\Omega$ is the set of all bijections from\n$$\n\\Omega \\to \\Omega\n$$\n\nThese bijections are called [**permutations**]{style=\"color: blue\"} any typically notated $\\sigma$ or $\\tau$\n:::\n\nNote the following properties of $S_\\Omega$\n\n- The identity of $S_\\Omega$ is the permutation $e$ where \n\n$$\ne(a) = a\\quad \\forall a \\in \\Omega\n$$\n\n- Every permutation $\\sigma \\colon \\Omega \\to \\Omega$ neccessarily has an inverse $\\sigma^{-1}$, because $\\sigma$ is a bijection.\n\n- The composition of any two bijections $\\sigma \\circ \\tau$ is itself a bijection, and therefore in $S_\\Omega$\n\nTherefore $(S_\\Omega, \\circ)$ is a group and its called the [**symmetric group**]{style=\"color: blue\"} on $\\Omega$. Usually we take $\\Omega$ as the first $n$ natural numbers, and denote the symmetric group $S_n$.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n## Example\n\nLets examine $\\Omega = \\{1,2,3\\}$. \n\nLet $\\sigma,\\tau \\in S_3$ be\n\n$$\n\\sigma \\colon \\{1,2,3\\} \\to \\{2,3,1\\}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau \\colon \\{1,2,3\\} \\to \\{2,1,3\\}\n$$\n\nWe can find $\\sigma \\circ \\tau$\n$$\n\\sigma \\circ \\tau \\colon \\{1,2,3\\} \\to \\{3,2,1\\}\n$$\n\nWhich is clearly in $S_3$\n::: \n\nThis notation is obtrusive and can be simplified using [**cycle decomposition**]{style=\"color: blue\"}.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Definition\n\nA [**cycle**]{style=\"color: blue\"} is a string of integers representing a permutation in $S_n$, denoted $(a_1\\,a_2\\,\\ldots\\,a_n)$.\n::: \n\nA cycle represents the permutation\n\n$$\n\\{a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n\\} \\to \\{a_2,a_3,\\ldots,a_1\\}\n$$\n\nCycles can be concatenated to greatly reduce the amount of space needed to represent a permutation. For example the permutation\n\n$$\n\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\} \\to \\{2,3,1,5,4,6\\}\n$$\n\nCan be represented as three cycles,\n\n$$\n(1\\,2\\,3)(4\\,5)(6)\n$$\n\nOften times cycles of length one are omitted. \n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\"}\n## Example\n\nGiven $S_3$, we know there exist $3! = 6$ total permutations of the set.\n\nThe identity permutation\n$$\n(1)(2)(3)\n$$\n\nThree examples where one number is left untouched\n$$\n(1)(2\\,3), (2)(1\\,3), (3)(1\\,2)\n$$\n\nAnd two examples where every number is permuted\n\n$$\n(1\\,2\\,3), (1\\,3\\,2)\n$$\n\n::: \n\nFor any $\\sigma \\in S_n$, the cycle decomposition of $\\sigma^{-1}$ is obtained by writing the numbers in cycle of the cycle decomposition of $\\sigma$ is in reverse order. For example\n\n$$\n\\sigma \\colon (1\\,2\\,3),\\quad \\sigma^{-1} \\colon (3\\,2\\,1).\n$$\n\nNote that $S_n$ is non-abelian for all $n\\geq3$. That being said, disjoint cycles will commute. The order of an element $\\sigma \\in S_n$ is the least common multiple of the lengths in it's cycle decomposition. For example, the order of \n\n$$\n\\sigma = (1\\,2\\,3)(4\\,5)(6)\n$$\n\nWould be $\\text{lcm}(3,2)$, thus $|\\sigma| = 6$.\n",
